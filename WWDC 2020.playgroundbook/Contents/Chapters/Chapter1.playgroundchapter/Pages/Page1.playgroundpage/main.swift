**Rhythm:** Let's see this by other way...

'Rhythm' is one of the three pilars of music('Harmony', 'Melody' and 'Rhythm') and commoly represented with others in a music score.
 
 But... let's do something... let's try to see a other way to "see" 'Rhythm'

 I'll show you some tools to help you to make this.
 
 First, when you press *"Run my Code"*, you'll see a clock and a little circle that have a sound into then.
 
 Try to drag the circle to one of positions of the clock... after you can go to next page...
