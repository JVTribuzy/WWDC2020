 **Rhythm:** Let's make a dance rhythm?
 
 OK, now you have more options of sounds to make something great... I trust you!
 
 Stay fantastic and make a goooooooood 'Rhythm', I'm trying to show that it's easier than they looks :)
 
 Thank you for enjoy this playground. Many things in our lives are easier than looks... programming, cooking... including music
 
 Congratulations, and I'll see you in WWDC 2020
